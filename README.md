Execute when you get teleported to the map.

Breaks animations and you can't use tools (When you take a tool out and someone touches you, you take control of them until they unequip the item.)

Usage: ``loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4M6D/MM2-Godmode/main/Godmode.lua"))()``
